No Homework On Stored Procedures

-- Creating a Stored Procedure

It's like a method, where you can pass in as many variables as you want to. 

Only difference is that you can also have a bunch of results come back into you.

-- The syntax -- 

CREATE PROCEDURE ProcedureName
	@UserID Int,
	@UserID Int,
AS
BEGIN
	-- Do Stuff in here

	SELECT * from [User] WHERE UserID = @UserID
	SELECT * FROM [Weapon] WHERE WeaponID = @UserID
END 
GO

EXEC MyProcedure @User10 = 10, @WeaponID = 11
