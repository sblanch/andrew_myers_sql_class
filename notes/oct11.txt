Control + R
==============
Toggle select output

Types of Tables
===============

-Lookup Table,
just key value pair, rarely changes
1 | gun
2 | knife
3 | taser

names of weapons is an example

-Flat Table,
has redundancy, but is quicker. Problem is it can get bigger.
Does prevent joins though.

-Mapping Table
One to many, or many to many
One officer can have many weapons

UserID | WeaponID

Primary key, identifier for that row in a table
foreign key, is a primary key for a different table

In select, displaying the detail in SSMS takes the longest. He said 10 times as long!
That is why SSMS has select first 1000.

Operators
=================

The <> vs !=
The != is faster from what he has tried.

SELECT * FROM User vs SELECT * from [User]
User is a keyword. With brackets it makes it no longer the keyword.

Schemas
================

A schema groups tables together. 
You can have multiple schemas.
[ServerName].[Database].[schema].[table]

If you can get everything into the same database server, that is way faster
than having databases across different servers

Master Table
================
Database that holds information for the database
Don't delete!

Keywords - Use
================
Use [database_name]
Command on the top to use the specific database.
This is good practice

Keywords - TOP
================
TOP
Top 10, gets first Top 10
Top goes off from the primary key
ie. SELECT Top 10 * from [User]

Keywords - SELECT
=================
If you need to grab something, use Select

Keywords - DISTINCT
====================
Makes it so there isn't any repeated rows

ie 
SELECT DISTINCT
	[LastName]
	, [FirstName]
FROM [User]

Keywords - --
====================
Comment the rest of the line

Keywords - WHERE
====================
Where is to filter

ie
SELECT *
FROM [User]
WHERE
	FirstName = 'Henry' OR
	FirstName = 'Tracey'


Keywords - LIKE
===================
% _ ^ []

Keywords - BETWEEN
===================

Keywords - OPERATORS
===================
>
=
LIKE
IS NULL
IS NOT NULL
<>
!=

Keywords - IN
===================
