Coalesce, have list of parameters and uses whatever first in list is not null.
ISNULL, is like Coalesce but only uses 2 parameters

=========================

Stored Procedures. They can output more than one thing. 


=========================

Views are like dummy stored procedure

Views are also like temp tables, but you have
to use only nested select statements

Views are made for basic stuff

There is a difference between an index view and a view.
Index views are preindexed, so they are faster.
Look it up on your own time for more information.

=========================

Functions are just like methods in c#. You can pass in as
many inputs as you want, but can only return 1 output.

Function are supposed to be common stuff used in stored procedures. 
Example: json parser, xml parser, aggregate functions(avg, count) (He likes json better, lol)

ORMs
========

Andrew Meyer's opinion...

Good points,
Small shop, good because it does it all for you

Bad stuff,
When things become complex, managing the ORMS becomes a nightmare. 
Going to raw queries becomes way better
Is also about 6 to 32 times slower than using ADO.net
Even those that are proficient at ORM agree that it is slower.
It is slower because it is built on top of ADO.net

He goes raw ADO.net. It is the fastest thing in this scenario.
